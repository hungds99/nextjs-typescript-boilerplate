### How to Get Started

Follow these steps to get the Next.js TypeScript boilerplate up and running locally:

#### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hungds99/nextjs-typescript-boilerplate.git
```

#### 2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd nextjs-typescript-boilerplate
```

#### 3. Install dependencies:

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Start the development server:

Run the following command to start the server locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`. You can open this URL in your browser to see the app running.

#### 5. Build for production (optional):

When you're ready to build for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build.

#### 6. Deploy the app:

You can deploy the app to [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), or any other platform that supports Next.js. For Vercel, you can simply link your GitHub repository, and it will handle the rest.
